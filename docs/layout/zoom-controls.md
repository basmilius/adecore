# ZoomControls

The zoom group of a dock: zoom out, the percentage with a menu of presets, zoom in, and fit everything.

```tsx
import { ZOOM_PRESETS, ZoomControls } from '@basmilius/react-ui';
```

<Demo src="layout/zoom-controls" />

The buttons step 10 percent at a time on the rounded percentage the readout shows, so plus and minus come back where they started. The readout opens a menu of presets that ticks the current one, and a row that fits everything. You keep the zoom and clamp it; `1` is 100%.

`selection` adds a menu row for zooming to what is selected. Leave it out on a surface with nothing to select. When nothing is selected, set `enabled: false`. The row stays and says it cannot act, rather than doing nothing.

`ZOOM_PRESETS` is the default list, `[25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200]`. The words come from the library in English or Dutch; `labels` replaces any of them with your own.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `zoom` | `number` | | Required. |
| `onZoomChange` | `(zoom: number) => void` | | Required. |
| `onFitAll` | `() => void` | | Required. |
| `presets` | `readonly number[]` | `ZOOM_PRESETS` | Percentages. |
| `labels` | `ZoomLabels` | | `{ out?, in?, presets?, fit?, fitEverything? }` |
| `shortcuts` | `{ zoomReset?: Shortcut; fitAll?: Shortcut }` | | Printed beside 100% and fit, and in the fit button's tooltip. |
| `selection` | `ZoomSelection` | | `{ label, enabled, onZoom, shortcut? }` |
| `className` | `string` | | |
| `ref` | `Ref<HTMLDivElement>` | | |

The shortcuts are only printed. Bind the keys on the window yourself. `ZoomControlsProps`, `ZoomLabels` and `ZoomSelection` are exported types.
