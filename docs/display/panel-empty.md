# PanelEmpty

An [`EmptyState`](/display/empty-state) that fills a panel or a card, centered in the room left under the panel's header.

```tsx
import { PanelEmpty } from '@basmilius/desktop-ui';
```

<Demo src="display/panel-empty" />

A panel is one track of a flex column, so by default the empty state grows into what is left of it (`fill="grow"`). A card is a box with a height of its own, where growing means nothing; use `fill="full"` there. `sunken` gives it the sunken ground, for a box that has no ground behind it yet. `header` keeps the panel's own header above the sentence, so a person can still act while nothing is listed.
