# Hover and problems

<Demo src="editor/hover" />

## Hover cards

Resting the pointer on a name for 300 milliseconds asks the service for its hover; the card closes 250 milliseconds after the pointer leaves the name and the card. `hover.quickInfo()` opens the card for the caret, as Ctrl+J on a Mac and Ctrl+Q elsewhere do, and it stays until the caret moves. `hover.keep()` pins the open card, `hover.hide()` closes it, and `hover.showRange(range)` opens an empty card over a range for the app to fill.

`HoverCard` splits the answer into its parts: the signature in code, the documentation as Markdown with its `@param` and other tags set apart, a browser-support baseline where the server gives one, and the problems at that place. A type name in the signature is a link to its definition, and the card counts the references of the name after half a second, where the service supports them. Markdown is GitHub-flavored without raw HTML. Code is colored through [`EditorRenderingProvider`](/editor-react/editor-view#editorrenderingprovider).

## Problems

The `DiagnosticsFeature` (`language.diagnostics`) turns the service's diagnostics into [markers](/editor/decorations#problems). A report replaces the earlier one of the same `source`, so two servers of a document do not erase each other. The markers follow the text until the next report. Diagnostic tags draw unused code faded and deprecated code struck through.

| Member                        | What it does                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `problems`                    | The problems of the file, as `Problem`s                    |
| `counts()`                    | `{ error, warning, info }`                                 |
| `at(position)`                | The problems at a position                                 |
| `step(direction)`             | Puts the caret on the next or previous problem, as F2 and Alt+Shift+F2 do |
| `goToFirst()`                 | Puts the caret on the first problem                        |
| `onChange(listener)`          | Called when the problems change                            |

`useProblemCounts(language)` reads `counts()` in a component and renders again when it changes; `null` gives zeros. For the problems of the whole project, see [`ProjectProblems`](/editor-react/project#problems).

## Semantic tokens, inlay hints and folds

These run without a field on `EditorLanguage`, after a pause in typing and when the service says its providers changed:

- Semantic tokens are asked in full, 200 milliseconds after an edit, and need a `legend` in the provider options. `decodeSemanticTokens` and `scopesOf` turn them into the scopes the editor colors through [`scopeColors`](/editor/theme#semantic-colors).
- Inlay hints are asked for the lines in view plus 60 lines on each side, 300 milliseconds after an edit or a scroll.
- Folding ranges and document symbols become [fold hints](/editor/find-folding#folding), and symbols become the blocks of sticky scroll and the breadcrumb.
- Selection ranges let Extend Selection grow through the server's ranges.
