# Rename and code actions

## Rename

<Demo src="editor/rename" />

`language.rename.start()` opens `RenameCard` over the name at the caret, as Shift+F6 does. When the service declares `prepareProvider`, it asks `textDocument/prepareRename` for the range and the placeholder first; otherwise it takes the word at the caret. The other uses of the name light up while the card is open.

In the card, Enter renames and Shift+Enter first lists the lines the rename changes, grouped by file, with Enter to apply them. Escape, or an edit in the file, cancels. A refusal of the service stays under the input, so the person can try another name. The edit goes through [`applyWorkspaceEdit`](/editor-react/project#workspace-edits), so open files take it as one undo step and other files become drafts. A rename that also moves files has no line list and is applied as a whole.

With `suggestNames` on the [host](/editor-react/project#languagehost), the card shows suggested names. The callback gets the name, the code around it and a few of its uses, with an `AbortSignal`; which model or rule answers is the app's choice.

## Code actions

<Demo src="editor/code-actions" />

`language.codeActions.open()` lists the actions for the caret or selection in a `PickPopup`, grouped as quick fixes, rewrites, extractions, inlines, moves, refactorings, source actions and the rest, as Alt+Enter does. A disabled action shows the server's reason. While the caret rests on a line with a fix, a lightbulb stands in the gutter; pressing it opens the same list.

| Method                    | What it lists or does                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open()`                  | All actions for the caret or selection                                 |
| `refactorThis()`          | Only the refactorings, structure first                                 |
| `quickFixFor(problem)`    | The fixes of one problem                                               |
| `organizeImports()`       | Applies the server's `source.organizeImports` action                   |
| `formatDocument()`        | Formats the file with the editor's indentation                         |
| `list(only)`, `apply(entry)` | The entries of some kinds, and one applied                          |

Applying resolves the action through `codeAction/resolve` when the server needs that, makes its edit through the project, and runs its command on the server that offered it. A command can ask the app to apply more edits through `workspace/applyEdit`; send those through the same `applyWorkspaceEdit`.

## Context menu

A right click asks the editor for a context menu, and `EditorContextMenu` draws it: go to definition, type definition and implementation, peek references, rename and code actions where the service supports them, a submenu of refactorings, cut, copy and paste, and format document. Each row shows its key from the key table. A right click outside the selection moves the caret there first.

`LanguagePopups` draws it with these rows only. `children` adds rows of the app between the refactorings and the clipboard rows, for an app that renders the menu itself.
