# @adecore/database

Browse, query and edit SQLite and MySQL or MariaDB databases from a desktop app. The package has React views for the page, a host for the app's backend and a native helper that talks to the servers.

```tsx
import { DatabaseWorkbench } from '@adecore/database';
```

<Demo src="database/workbench" fill />

The demos on these pages run on [`fakeDatabaseTransport`](/database/api/testing), an in-memory shop with customers, products and orders. Open a table in the workbench above, edit a cell and submit it: the change stays until the page reloads. The fake runs no SQL beyond `SELECT * FROM <table>`, so a console, a filter or the designer's Apply only look the way they would on a real server.

## What is in it

- [`ConnectionManager`](/database/views/connection-manager) and [`ConnectionForm`](/database/views/connection-manager#connectionform) edit the saved connections: SQLite files, and MySQL or MariaDB servers over TCP, a socket, SSH or a Docker container.
- [`DatabaseExplorer`](/database/views/explorer) is a tree of connections, schemas, tables and columns.
- [`TableView`](/database/views/table-view) shows the rows of a table, with filters, editing, a record view, a value panel, and export and import.
- [`StructureView`](/database/views/structure-view) shows the structure of a table, and [`TableDesigner`](/database/views/table-designer) creates and alters one.
- [`QueryConsole`](/database/views/query-console) runs SQL, with history, paging, transactions and export.
- [`DatabaseWorkbench`](/database/views/workbench) puts the explorer beside tabs for all of these. An app with tabs of its own answers the [actions](/database/guide/tabs) of the views instead.

## Three layers

| Layer                | Entry point              | Runs in                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Views and the client | `@adecore/database`      | The page: React 19, in a browser window |
| Host                 | `@adecore/database/host` | The app's backend: Bun or Node          |
| Helper               | `adecore-database`       | A native process the host starts        |

Two more entry points import nothing from React or Node, so any layer can read them: `@adecore/database/protocol` holds the types of every message, and `@adecore/database/testing` holds the in-memory transport. The platform packages (`@adecore/database-darwin-arm64` and three others) carry the prebuilt helper and no code.

```
page            views, createDatabaseClient(transport)
  |
app channel     ipcMain.handle, a utility process, a WebSocket
  |
backend         createDatabaseHost, spawnHelper
  |
helper          adecore-database, one JSON message per line
  |
server          SQLite file, MySQL or MariaDB
```

The views never talk to a server. They call a [`DatabaseSession`](/database/api/client#databasesession), and the client sends [protocol](/database/guide/protocol) requests through a `DatabaseTransport`: one function that takes a request and resolves with the response. The app writes it over a channel it already has, such as Electron IPC or a WebSocket.

On the other end of that channel the app hands each request to the [host](/database/api/host). The host checks the shape of the request, keeps each owner's sessions apart, asks the app about connections, files and discovery, and passes the request to the helper. The package registers no channel of its own, because the app has to check who is asking first. See [Security](/database/guide/security).

The views leave placement to the app: where a table opens, which file dialog appears, where a setting is kept. [`DatabaseProvider`](/database/guide/getting-started#databaseprovider) takes `onAction`, `files` and `storage` for those.

## Why a separate helper

The database drivers live in a Rust binary, not in the backend:

- A driver that crashes takes down the helper and nothing else. The host fails the running requests with `helper-exited` and starts a new helper on the next request.
- The same binary runs under Bun, Node and Electron's utility process. There is no native module to rebuild per runtime.
- The helper pages the rows and cuts long cells down to a preview, so the backend never holds a whole table.

## What crosses the wire

Every message is JSON, so any channel can carry it.

- A value that a JavaScript number cannot hold exactly arrives as text: an integer beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, a decimal, a date and a time. The `kind` of the column says how to read it.
- A long cell arrives as a preview: `{ kind: 'longText', preview, length }` for text and `{ kind: 'binary', hex, length }` for bytes. A view asks for the whole value with the `cell` method when a person opens or edits it.
- Rows come in pages of at most 10000, and each page says whether more rows follow. Counting all rows is a separate request, since it is slow on a big table. An export streams every row to a file without passing it through the page.

## Where to go next

- [Getting started](/database/guide/getting-started) installs the package and wires the three layers.
- [Connections](/database/guide/connections) covers TCP, sockets, SSH, Docker and container discovery.
- [Opening tables as tabs](/database/guide/tabs) answers `onAction` with an app's own tabs.
- [Files](/database/guide/files) covers export, import and the check on paths.
- [Security](/database/guide/security) lists what the host checks and what the app must.
- [Protocol](/database/guide/protocol) lists every method, error code and the helper's wire format.
- The API: [client](/database/api/client), [host](/database/api/host) and [testing](/database/api/testing).
