# Typing and commands

Three methods turn what a person does into edits on every caret at once. Each returns whether anything changed, and each reads the `language` option to tell code from comments and strings. Without a language, `typeText` and `paste` assume `typescript`.

## typeText

`typeText(text, options?)` is one keystroke. With a single character it does what a code editor does on that key:

- An opening bracket brings its closer when nothing after the caret already closes it. A quote pairs only when no identifier character follows.
- Typing a closer the editor added steps over it. That counts as a change, so `typeText` returns `true` with the text unchanged.
- A bracket, quote or `<` typed over a selection wraps it. A quote typed over one quote of a string swaps both.
- A closing bracket typed alone on its line moves back to the indentation of its opener.
- In TypeScript, JavaScript and PHP a `;` typed just before the `)` and `]` that close a call goes past them, to the end of the statement.
- In PHP a `-` typed right after a variable, a property or method name after `->`, or a `)` or `]` becomes `->`, with the `>` as an undo step of its own. A `>` typed next goes over it, and so does Backspace, which takes both. A key that cannot follow `->` (anything but a letter, `_` or `{`) makes it a minus again, typed with that key.

```ts
const document = new DocumentModel('call(x)');

document.setSelections([{ anchor: 6, head: 6 }]);
document.typeText(';', { language: 'typescript' });
document.getText(); // 'call(x);'
```

Nothing pairs in plain text (`text`, `plaintext`, `txt` or `log`), inside a comment, or inside a string. Longer text is inserted as it is. Consecutive calls join one undo step, the `typing` group.

## paste

`paste(text, options?)` writes the text with the document's own line breaks. With as many lines as carets, each caret takes one line. With `wholeLines: true`, for text copied from a bare caret, the text goes above the line of each bare caret. A block that lands in code moves to the indentation of the line it lands on, unless `indentOnPaste` is `false`.

## execute

`execute(command, options?)` runs an `EditorCommand` on every caret.

| Group                 | Commands                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| History and selection | `undo`, `redo`, `selectAll`, `expandSelection`, `shrinkSelection`                                                                        |
| Words                 | `wordLeft`, `wordRight`, `selectWordLeft`, `selectWordRight`, `deleteWordLeft`, `deleteWordRight` and the same six with `camel`           |
| Line edges            | `smartHome`, `smartEnd`, `selectSmartHome`, `selectSmartEnd`                                                                             |
| Deleting              | `smartBackspace`, `deleteForward`                                                                                                        |
| Lines                 | `duplicateLine`, `deleteLine`, `moveLineUp`, `moveLineDown`, `joinLines`, `toggleCase`, `autoIndentLines`                               |
| Indentation           | `insertTab`, `indent`, `outdent`                                                                                                         |
| Comments              | `toggleLineComment`, `toggleBlockComment`                                                                                                |
| New lines             | `insertNewline`, `startNewLine`, `startNewLineBefore`, `splitLine`                                                                       |
| Carets                | `addCaretAbove`, `addCaretBelow`, `addCaretPerSelectedLine`, `selectNextOccurrence`, `unselectOccurrence`, `selectAllOccurrences`        |

A few of them do more than their name says:

- `insertNewline` continues a line comment when text follows the caret, closes and continues a `/**` block, splits a string with the language's concatenation, indents after an opener or a `case` label, and closes a brace nothing closes.
- `smartHome` goes to the first non-blank character, and from there to the start of the line.
- `smartBackspace` with only whitespace before the caret, in a language whose brackets set the indentation, works from where the brackets put the line. A line indented past that goes back to it in one step. A line at or before it joins the line above, with the spacing of `joinLines` and no space when the line is empty, so an empty line under `{` goes to the end of the `{`; a blank line above is taken instead. Elsewhere, in comments and strings, it goes back a tab stop, and at the start of a line it also takes the whitespace that trails the line above.
- `insertTab` steps over a closer the editor added before it inserts anything.
- `selectNextOccurrence` from a bare caret selects the word, then the next whole word with the same case. From a selection it finds the text anywhere, also inside other words. When there is no further match, `occurrencesExhausted` on the model is `true` until the next press starts over.
- `expandSelection` grows through the word, the inside of a string or bracket pair, the pair itself, the line and the document, and `shrinkSelection` walks back. A host with better ranges, such as those of a language server, passes them to `expandSelectionTo(ranges)`, one `OffsetRange` or `null` per selection.

The plain word commands stop at camel humps only with `camelCase: true`; the `camel` variants always do. `wordSelectionAt`, `wordStartBefore` and `wordEndAfter` give the same word stops for a double click and a drag.

## Options

`CommandOptions` reaches all three methods. Every switch is on unless it says otherwise.

| Option                                       | Default        | Meaning                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language`                                   | `'typescript'` | The language id, for comments, strings, brackets and indentation      |
| `tabSize`                                    | `4`            | Clamped to 1 through 16                                               |
| `insertSpaces`                               | `true`         | Indent with spaces                                                    |
| `commentToken`                               |                | Replaces the line comment marker of the language                      |
| `camelCase`                                  | `false`        | Plain word commands stop at camel humps                               |
| `autoClosingPairs`                           | on             | Brackets and quotes together; the next two turn off one kind          |
| `autoClosingBrackets`, `autoClosingQuotes`   | on             |                                                                       |
| `surroundSelection`                          | on             | A bracket or quote typed over a selection wraps it                    |
| `smartSemicolon`                             | on             | Only in TypeScript, JavaScript and PHP                                |
| `smartArrow`                                 | on             | In PHP a `-` after a variable, a member, `)` or `]` becomes `->`      |
| `tabOutOfClosers`                            | on             | Tab steps over a closer the editor added                              |
| `smartEnter`                                 | on             | Enter computes indentation, continues comments and closes braces      |
| `indentOnPaste`                              | on             | A pasted block takes the indentation of its line                      |
| `visualLine(offset)`                         |                | The wrapped row an offset is on, so Home and End go by rows           |
| `lineSpan(line)`                             |                | The lines that stand on one row, such as a collapsed fold             |
| `onLinesMoved(moves)`                        |                | Where each line went after a move, as `{ from, to }` pairs            |

`typeText` also takes `historyGroup` and `expectedRevision`, and `paste` takes `wholeLines`.

A view with folds passes `lineSpan`: a collapsed fold is then one line to delete, duplicate, comment and move, one word stop, and a row that `addCaretAbove` and `addCaretBelow` skip. `onLinesMoved` lets the view move whatever it keeps by line, such as a fold, along with the text.

## Comments

`toggleLineComment` and `toggleBlockComment` read a table of markers per language: `//` and `/* */` for the C family, PHP, JSON and the like, `#` for Python, shell, YAML and others, `<!-- -->` for HTML, XML and Markdown, `--` for SQL, Lua and Haskell. In a Vue file the marker follows the block the caret is in. A language with block comments only, such as CSS, wraps each line. An id the table does not know has no markers, and the toggle does nothing.
