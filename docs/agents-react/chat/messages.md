# Messages and code

The renderers the thread draws text with, for a message, a note or a block of output outside it.

```tsx
import { Markdown, MessageMarkdown, ReplyMarkdown } from '@adecore/agents-react/chat/ui/Markdown';
```

<Demo src="agents/markdown" />

## Markdown

Three renderers, for three kinds of text. All of them write GitHub-flavored Markdown with the typography plugin's `prose` styles, and none of them renders raw HTML.

- `MessageMarkdown({ text, mentions?, skills? })` is what a person sent. A line break is a line break, a tag typed without backticks stays text, and the files and skills picked in the composer are chips again.
- `ReplyMarkdown({ text, streaming, arriving? })` is a reply. It parses a block at a time, so a streamed word only parses the block that grows. While `streaming`, new words fade in and a code fence that is still open is highlighted as it grows; `arriving` fades in each block instead.
- `Markdown({ text, breaks?, fileLinks?, rehypePlugins?, componentOverrides? })` is any other text, such as a note from your app. `breaks` keeps line breaks, and `fileLinks` (on by default) turns paths into links through the host's `fileLinks`.

A path becomes a link only when the host's `fileLinks.target(text, cwd)` finds one in it. `FileLinkContext` gives the folder a relative path counts from; the thread sets it to the chat's own `cwd`.

## CodeBlock

A fenced block, highlighted with Shiki in the theme the host's `code` names for the current mode. The grammar and the theme load on first use, and the block holds its shape until they are there, so it never flashes uncolored. An unknown language stays plain text.

<Demo src="agents/code-block" />

```tsx
<CodeBlock code={source} lang="ts" />
```

`useCodeTheme()` answers the theme id in use. `CodeStreamingContext` tells a block that its fence is still open, which `ReplyMarkdown` sets.

Every block has a Copy icon that copies its `code` text, including whitespace and line endings. The controls show on hover or keyboard focus, and always on a device without hover. A failed clipboard write shows an error, never a copied state. The optional `actions` node adds controls of your own beside Copy, in the same block. The code scrolls apart from the controls. A reply of the chat itself puts the host's [shell action](/agents-react/guide/host#slots-and-cards) there.

## AnsiOutput and FadingWords

`AnsiOutput({ text, limit?, tailLines? })` draws the output of a command with its colors, bold, italics and underlines. Every other control sequence, cursor moves and links included, is dropped rather than shown. `tailLines` keeps the last lines and `limit` the first characters, with a line saying how many were left out. The colors come from the `--term-ansi-*` tokens; see [CSS](/agents-react/guide/getting-started#css).

`FadingWords({ text })` fades in each word as text grows, the effect a streamed reply has.

<Demo src="agents/ansi-output" />

`parseAnsi(text, options)` and `stripAnsi(text)` are the parsing on its own. `wordSegments`, `rehypeFadeWords`, `rehypeChips` and `remarkHtmlAsText` are the plugins the renderers are built from, and `splitMarkdownBlocks` the block splitting `ReplyMarkdown` does.
