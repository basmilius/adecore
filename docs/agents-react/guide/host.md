# Host adapters

`setChatHost(patch)` hands the views what only the app around them can decide. Call it once, before the first render. `chatHost()` answers what is set now. The host is one for the whole page, shared by every scope, so a function that is about one host of chats gets its `scopeId`.

```ts
import { setChatHost, chatHost } from '@adecore/agents-react/host';
```

A patch replaces top-level fields only: to change one function of `code`, `prompts`, `attachments`, `accents`, `tasks`, `confirm` or `dictation`, pass the whole object. A change is not React state and redraws nothing, so hand stable functions and let the hooks among them read your own state. A field whose name starts with `use` is called as a React hook.

## Fields

| Field                              | Without it                                         | What it is for                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `storage`                          | `localStorage`, under `adecore.*`                  | Where drafts and preferences are kept. See [Persistence](/agents-react/guide/persistence).              |
| `notify(toast)`                    | Nothing is shown                                   | A `ChatToast`: errors, successes, and a deletion with an undo `action`.                                |
| `actions`                          | Every action is a request on the scope's transport | A `ChatActions` of your own, to run each action through a door of your own.                            |

| `attachments`                      | No previews; reading rejects                       | `useUrl` for a URL to an attached file's bytes, `read` for the bytes as a `Blob`.                      |
| `ReadImage`                        | Nothing under a tool that read an image            | A component that draws the image at `path`.                                                            |
| `intelligentUi`                    | Choices stay closed, live values and links stay as first read | `sendChoice`, `query`, `link`, `openLink`, `openUrl` and `subscribe` for [Intelligent UI](/intelligent-ui/guide/getting-started#draw-the-blocks) blocks. |
| `fileLinks`                        | Paths in a reply stay text                         | `target(text, cwd, scopeId)` finds a `FileRef`; `open(cwd, ref, scopeId)` opens it on its rendering scope.                              |
| `code`                             | Light, `github-light` and `github-dark`            | `useMode()` follows the app's light or dark, `useThemes()` names the Shiki themes, `custom` registers your own. |

| `useSendDelivery()` | `queue` | How Send handles running work: `queue` after the turn, or `steer` at the next native input boundary. Option or Alt selects the other behavior. |
| `useTimelineFind(options)`         | No find in a thread                                | Find in a thread: you get the rows and refs, you hand back a `TimelineFind` with the bar to draw.      |

| `ComposerSlot`                     | Nothing                                            | A control of your own in the composer's row, with `insert(text)` to type into the draft.               |

| `useThreadCards(scopeId, chatId)`  | No cards                                           | Cards of your own between the messages, each `{ id, at, render }`.                                     |
| `useReplyAuthor(scopeId, chatId)`  | The agent is named for screen readers only         | A header over each reply: `{ name, mark? }`.                                                           |
| `visuals`                          | No visuals in a thread                             | A `VisualHost`: where the pages agents publish are drawn, and how a link in one opens. See [Visuals](#visuals). |
| `accents`                          | No colors                                          | The colors an account may wear: `all`, the `featured` ones, a `label` and the `current` accent.        |
| `isApplePlatform()`, `isAppShortcut(event)` | From `@adecore/ui`; no shortcut           | Which modifier is Mod, and keys the app keeps even while the composer has focus.                       |

A default leaves a part out; it is not a policy. A view's `disabled` stops nothing on the host: the host checks every request itself.

## Actions

The views run every action on a chat through a `ChatActions`: clear, stop, unqueue, send now, compact, configure, continue on another account, read a turn's diff, stop a subagent or a task, approve, answer and dismiss. With `actions: null` each one is the request of the same name on the transport of the scope it runs in (`transportActions(transport)`). `useChatActions()` and `actionsOf(scope)` answer the set in use.

A set of your own is one for the page and gets only chat ids, so it has to know which host each chat is on. Wrap the requests rather than replace them, and keep the `code` of a refusal:

```ts
import { transportActions } from '@adecore/agents-react/chat/actions';
import { setChatHost, type ChatActions } from '@adecore/agents-react/host';

const base = transportActions(transport);
const actions: ChatActions = {
    ...base,
    stopTurn: async (chatId, subagents) => {
        activityLog.add(`Stopped ${chatId}`);
        await base.stopTurn(chatId, subagents);
    }
};

setChatHost({ actions });
```

## Slots and cards

`renderShellCodeBlock` is optional. It returns a React node in the top-right action group of each top-level `sh`, `bash` or `zsh` fence in a main assistant reply, beside Copy, including when syntax highlighting fails. Return a compact control such as an `IconButton`; dialogs can use their usual portal. The callback signature and optional behavior are unchanged. Its typed `ShellCodeBlockContext` contains `scopeId`, `chatId`, `itemId`, `language`, exact `code` and `complete`. The code preserves the source body's whitespace and line endings; opening and closing fence lines and their separating line breaks are excluded.

`complete` requires both a closed fence and a main reply that stopped streaming. A closed block displayed early in `blocks` mode still has `complete: false`. The callback is not called for file Markdown, user messages, thinking, tool output, reports, nested or quoted fences, or subagent conversations. Hosts may return `null` until complete. Rendering must only create controls; an action runs from the person's event handler. The host must validate the source and destination again when acting.

```tsx
setChatHost({
    renderShellCodeBlock: (context) => context.complete
        ? <button onClick={() => previewCommand(context)}>Preview command</button>
        : null
});
```

`ComposerSlot` gets `{ scopeId, chatId, disabled, insert }`; `insert(text)` puts text at the caret, a space apart from its neighbors, and focuses the editor. `SubagentSlot` gets `{ chatId, items }` and is drawn only when there are subagents. A thread card has an `id` unique in the chat, an `at` on the clock of the items' `createdAt`, and a `render()` that runs only while the card is on screen. Return the same array from `useThreadCards` while nothing changed: a new array lays out every row again.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@adecore/ui';
import { setChatHost, type ComposerSlotProps } from '@adecore/agents-react/host';

function InsertSelection({ disabled, insert }: ComposerSlotProps) {
    return (
        <Button size="sm" disabled={disabled} onClick={() => insert(editor.selectedText())}>
            Insert selection
        </Button>
    );
}

setChatHost({ ComposerSlot: InsertSelection });
```

## Visuals

A thread draws the visuals of its chat, pages an agent published, only when `visuals` is set. A `VisualHost` is `{ frameUrl, openLink(url) }`:

- `frameUrl` is the address of the sandbox host page, [`VISUAL_HOST_PAGE`](/agent-contracts/visuals#serving-a-page) from `@adecore/agent-contracts/visual`, served from your code. A frame adds the theme to it as a fragment.
- `openLink(url)` opens an http or https link a person followed in a visual, outside the app, such as in their browser.

```ts
import { setChatHost } from '@adecore/agents-react/host';

setChatHost({
    visuals: {
        frameUrl: 'https://visuals.example.test/frame.html',
        openLink: (url) => openInBrowser(url)
    }
});
```

The frame reads a page's bytes through `attachments.read`, since a stored page is an attachment of its chat whose id is the visual's own. Serve the host page on an origin other than the app's, or on a path of the app's own origin with a `Content-Security-Policy` that adds `sandbox allow-scripts allow-forms` and limits `frame-ancestors` to the app. Either is safe, since the frame never gets `allow-same-origin`. The host page's policy is the page's too, so it lets a page run its inline scripts and styles and load the public sources you want pages to reach, and your app's own policy allows the host page as a frame source. Never serve a stored page on the app's origin. [Serving a page](/agent-contracts/visuals#serving-a-page) has the details, [Visuals](/agents-react/chat/visuals) how a thread draws them.

## Lazy modules

The diff views and a few heavy parts load on first use. `setLazyPrefetch(register)` hands every such loader to a prefetcher of yours, the ones made so far and every later one. `onLazyOpenError(listener)` tells you when a loader fails during a render, and answers the function that stops listening; a failed prefetch does not reach it. `lazyNamed(load, name)` is the `React.lazy` they are made with, for a module that exports its component by name.
