# @adecore/agents-react

React views for agent chats: the thread, the composer, approvals and questions, the agent CLIs and their accounts, and what they cost. It runs in the page and talks to a host of chats, such as [`@adecore/agents`](/agents/), over the requests and events of [`@adecore/agent-contracts`](/agent-contracts/). It starts no process and registers no channel.

```tsx
import { Timeline } from '@adecore/agents-react/chat/ui/Timeline';
import { Composer } from '@adecore/agents-react/chat/ui/Composer';
```

<Demo src="agents/chat" />

The demos on these pages run on a host in memory: two CLIs, three accounts, a chat two turns in, usage for the last months. Send a message and it answers a word at a time; mention a check or a test and it asks for permission first. Open the helper agent's row to read its own conversation. Nothing leaves the page.

## What is in it

- Chat: [`Timeline`](/agents-react/chat/timeline) draws the thread and [`Composer`](/agents-react/chat/composer) writes to it, with [prompts](/agents-react/chat/prompts) for the approvals and questions a chat waits on. [Messages and code](/agents-react/chat/messages), [diffs](/agents-react/chat/diffs), [subagents](/agents-react/chat/subagents), [limits](/agents-react/chat/limits) and [smaller parts](/agents-react/chat/parts) are there for a layout of your own.
- Providers: [`ProvidersPane`](/agents-react/providers/providers-pane) is the settings of the CLIs and their accounts; [marks](/agents-react/providers/marks) and the [model picker](/agents-react/providers/model-picker) are its parts.
- Usage: [`UsagePage`](/agents-react/usage/usage-page) shows what the CLIs cost over a period, with its [charts and tiles](/agents-react/usage/charts) and the [plan limits](/agents-react/usage/limits).

## How it fits together

```
your app        setChatHost(...)          words, storage, files, navigation
  |
scope           ChatScopeContext          one per host of chats
  |               transport               requests and events
  |               ChatClient              writes them into the stores
  |
views           Timeline, Composer, ...   read the stores of their scope
```

The views read a chat from a store, never from the wire. A `ChatClient` fills that store from a `ChatTransport`, the one object that knows how to reach the host. A `ChatScope` bundles the two with an id and puts them in context, so an app that talks to two hosts renders a scope for each and their threads never mix. What only the app can decide, such as where a file opens or whether a stop needs a confirmation, it hands over once with `setChatHost`.

## Entry points

There is no root import. Every module has its own subpath, `@adecore/agents-react/<path>`, without an extension; the [module reference](/agents-react/reference) lists all of them. `DiffPool`, `EditDiff` and `UnifiedDiff` are default exports, everything else is named. Two entries are assets: `@adecore/agents-react/theme.css` and the words under `@adecore/agents-react/locales/<language>/<namespace>.json`.

## Where to go next

- [Getting started](/agents-react/guide/getting-started) installs the package, its CSS and its words, and renders a first chat.
- [Host adapters](/agents-react/guide/host) lists what `setChatHost` takes and what each part does without it.
- [Chat client and state](/agents-react/guide/chat-client) covers opening, sending, reconnecting and reading the stores.
- [Persistence](/agents-react/guide/persistence) covers drafts, preferences and their storage keys.
- [Testing](/agents-react/guide/testing) shows a host in memory like the one these demos use.
