# Testing

`@adecore/ui/testing` holds fakes for your app's own tests, and `@adecore/ui/testing/dedupe` a preload for `bun test` with a linked checkout. Nothing in either belongs in a bundle that ships.

```ts
import { fakeFormatSource } from '@adecore/ui/testing';
```

## fakeFormatSource

A [format source](/ui/formatting/) you set by hand. It starts in English, in the region of the language, with no system locale of a shell. Hand it to `setFormatSource` and set the region a test expects, so its numbers and dates do not depend on the machine that runs it. The region of the language follows `navigator.language` where the runtime has one.

```ts
import { afterAll, afterEach, expect, test } from 'bun:test';
import { formatNumber, setFormatSource } from '@adecore/ui/format';
import { fakeFormatSource } from '@adecore/ui/testing';

const source = fakeFormatSource();
const previous = setFormatSource(source);

afterEach(() => {
    source.set({ language: 'en', region: 'language' });
});

afterAll(() => {
    setFormatSource(previous);
});

test('a count is grouped the way the region groups one', () => {
    source.set({ region: 'nl-NL' });
    expect(formatNumber(1234567)).toBe('1.234.567');
});
```

`set({ language?, region? })` changes either setting. It notifies no subscriber, so a component that is already drawn keeps what it wrote until it renders again. `setFormatSource` returns the source it replaced, which the file puts back when it is done. A component under test draws with the fake if you pass it to `UIProvider` as `formatSource`.

`FakeFormatSource` is an exported type, a `FormatSource` with `set`.

## A linked checkout under bun test

An app that links a checkout of the library (see [Getting started](/ui/guide/getting-started#working-on-a-local-checkout)) loads the checkout's own React, i18next and Base UI next to its own under `bun test`, since the checkout has a `node_modules` of its own. The first hook then fails with "Invalid hook call", and a compound part finds no root. Vite has `resolve.dedupe` for this; Bun has nothing like it. The library ships a preload that does the same for a test run. Put it first in `bunfig.toml`, before any preload that imports the library:

```toml
[test]
preload = ["@adecore/ui/testing/dedupe", "./test-preload.ts"]
```

It loads every file of `react`, `react-dom`, `i18next`, `react-i18next` and `@base-ui-components/react` inside the checkout as a stand-in for the same file in the app's copy. The app's copy is the one the folder `bun test` runs in resolves to, or else the one of the first workspace that depends on the library. A package the checkout has no copy of is left alone, so the preload does nothing once the library comes from the registry.

A bunfig at the root of a monorepo with an isolated install may not resolve the package itself, since only the workspace depends on it. Point at the file through the workspace instead:

```toml
[test]
preload = ["./apps/web/node_modules/@adecore/ui/src/testing/dedupe.ts"]
```

## Rendering in a test

The components render in any React test setup. Wrap them in `UIProvider` with an i18next instance, so they find their words:

```tsx
const i18n = i18next.createInstance();
await i18n.init({ lng: 'en', resources: {} });

const markup = renderToStaticMarkup(
    <UIProvider i18n={i18n} formatSource={fakeFormatSource()}>
        <Stepper label="Size" value={3} onValueChange={() => {}} min={1} max={5} step={1} />
    </UIProvider>
);
```
