# ConfirmDialog

One destructive step, asked before it happens, over whichever dialog it was opened from. It is a [`PromptDialog`](/ui/overlays/prompt-dialog) with the danger button, stacked as a nested dialog, that closes itself once the step succeeds.

```tsx
import { ConfirmDialog } from '@adecore/ui/settings';
```

<Demo src="settings/confirm-dialog" />

`onConfirm` returns a promise. While it runs the button is disabled. When it resolves the dialog closes; when it rejects, the reason stays on screen and the dialog stays open.
