# Coordination

Modules for agents that hand each other work: an outbox that keeps a promise across restarts, tasks between a chat and the chats it opened, the lineage of who opened whom, and messages between chats. A plain `AgentHost` installs none of them; a host that lets agents work together composes them around its core. Keep their files outside every folder an agent can write to, and check who may do what before a call reaches them.

## Outbox

`OutboxStore` keeps one record per thing owed, validated by a Zod schema of the work, under `outbox/` in the data folder. `OutboxWorker` runs them oldest first per target, different targets side by side. `enqueue` resolves once the work is on disk, not once it ran.

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { OutboxStore } from '@adecore/agents/outbox/outbox';
import { OutboxWorker } from '@adecore/agents/outbox/outbox-worker';
import { ManualClock } from '@adecore/agents/outbox/manual-clock';

export async function runOutboxExample(dataDir: string): Promise<string[]> {
    const WorkSchema = z.object({ kind: z.literal('record-result'), payload: z.object({ text: z.string() }) });
    const store = new OutboxStore({ dataDir, work: WorkSchema });
    await store.load();
    const completed = new Map<string, string>();
    const clock = new ManualClock();
    const worker = new OutboxWorker({
        store,
        clock,
        handlers: {
            'record-result': async (entry) => {
                completed.set(entry.id, entry.payload.text);
            }
        }
    });
    worker.start();
    try {
        await worker.enqueue('project-1', 'child-1', { kind: 'record-result', payload: { text: 'Checked the fixture.' } });
        await worker.settled();
        return [...completed.values()];
    } finally {
        worker.stop();
    }
}
```

A handler that throws is tried again after 1, 5 and 30 seconds (`RETRY_DELAYS_MS`); after that the entry is removed and handed to `onParked`, which is where a record of the failure belongs. A handler that answers `'wait'` keeps its entry, without using an attempt, until `wake(target)`. A handler can run again after a crash, when it finished before its entry was removed, so make it idempotent: key what it writes on the entry's id.

`stop()` schedules nothing more but does not interrupt a handler that runs; `settled()` waits for those, not for retries or waiting entries. `ManualClock` moves time by hand in a test.

## Tasks

A task is what a chat asked of a chat it opened. `TaskStore` keeps them under `tasks/`, and `wireTasks` puts the parts together over a core and an outbox: the coordinator that settles tasks, the outbox work that starts and wakes chats, and the verbs a context command calls. This is all of it, with your app's placement and notifications stood in for by a set and an array:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import type { ChatCore } from '@adecore/agents/chat/chat-core';
import { OutboxStore } from '@adecore/agents/outbox/outbox';
import { OutboxWorker } from '@adecore/agents/outbox/outbox-worker';
import { TaskStore } from '@adecore/agents/tasks/task-store';
import { restartBackgroundLimits } from '@adecore/agents/tasks/background-limit';
import { BackgroundLimitWorkSchema, DeliverWaitingWorkSchema, GiveTaskWorkSchema, WakeParentWorkSchema } from '@adecore/agents/tasks/task-work';
import { wireTasks } from '@adecore/agents/tasks/wiring';

export async function openTaskServices(dataDir: string, chats: ChatCore, placedIds: ReadonlySet<string>) {
    const WorkSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('kind', [BackgroundLimitWorkSchema, DeliverWaitingWorkSchema, GiveTaskWorkSchema, WakeParentWorkSchema]);
    const outbox = new OutboxStore({ dataDir, work: WorkSchema });
    const tasks = new TaskStore(dataDir);
    await outbox.load();
    await tasks.load();
    await restartBackgroundLimits(outbox, Date.now());
    const alerts: Array<{ nodeId: string; title: string; body: string }> = [];
    let worker: OutboxWorker<z.infer<typeof WorkSchema>>;
    const wiring = wireTasks({
        tasks,
        chats,
        outbox: {
            list: () => outbox.list(),
            enqueue: (projectId, target, work, notBefore) => worker.enqueue(projectId, target, work, notBefore),
            remove: (id) => outbox.remove(id),
            wake: (target) => worker.wake(target)
        },
        placed: (nodeId) => placedIds.has(nodeId),
        titleFor: (nodeId) => (placedIds.has(nodeId) ? nodeId : null),
        alert: (nodeId, title, body) => {
            alerts.push({ nodeId, title, body });
        },
        words: { app: 'Example host', cli: 'app-context' }
    });
    worker = new OutboxWorker({ store: outbox, handlers: wiring.handlers, onParked: wiring.onParked });
    await wiring.recover();
    worker.start();
    return {
        tasks,
        wiring,
        worker,
        alerts,
        async close(): Promise<void> {
            wiring.waiting.stop();
            wiring.coordinator.stop();
            worker.stop();
            await wiring.coordinator.settled();
            await worker.settled();
        }
    };
}
```

- `verbs.open(record)` records a task for a chat the caller just opened; starting that chat is yours. `verbs.give(record)` gives a task to a chat that exists and owes it the turn that carries it. `verbs.done(childId, text)` settles the child's open task, `chatState(nodeId)` says whether a chat is missing, idle or running, and `involving(nodeId)` lists its tasks.
- A task settles when the child says it is done, when its first turn ends, or when its process leaves. A subagent or workflow of the child's CLI that still runs keeps it open; a background command for at most 30 minutes. A child that waits out a usage limit stays open and wakes nobody.
- A settled task wakes its parent once the parent has no turn running; tasks of one `batchId` wake it together. The wake carries the first 8 KiB of the result, and `words.restOf(childId)` says where the rest is read.
- A child's approval or question that waits 15 seconds leaves a note in the parent, without starting a turn there.
- `prune(projectId, ids)` cancels the tasks of chats your app removed, rather than failing them.

`TaskStore.subscribe` tells you of every task written; send it over your own protocol as `TaskChangedEventSchema`. `wireTasks` watches the core for the life of the core: wire it once per core.

## Lineage

`AgentLineageStore` keeps under `lineage/` which chat opened which, at what depth, in which project, with which ceiling on its runtime mode, and when it ended. A fork a person made is recorded with `relation: 'fork'` and is no descendant of the chat it came from. `depthOf` and `openedCount` let your app cap how deep and how many; the store caps nothing itself. `ceilingForOpening(opener, requested)` refuses a mode wider than the opener's: keep the ceiling it answers and clamp later starts with `narrowerMode`, so a restart never widens an agent.

`endChildren` ends the chats a chat opened, and theirs. Add `EndChildrenWorkSchema` to the outbox; `owe(target)` writes the obligation first, and its handler marks the lineage ended, removes work that would start them again, cancels their tasks, and stops them deepest first through your `stop(nodeId, reason)`. List every kind of work of your own that would start a chat again in `reviving`.

## Messages

`NoticeStore` keeps the messages waiting for a chat under `notices/`, at most ten per chat and for six hours. `take` hands them to the model once; `show` marks them seen by a person, independently.

After you checked who may write to whom, `deliverToChat(store, chatNoticeTargets(core), notice)` stores a message and answers what happens next: `wake` owes a turn (put a `DeliverMessageWorkSchema` entry in the outbox, handled by `deliverMessageHandler`), `no-chat` and `in-turn` leave it for the chat's next prompt, and `from-message` means the turn writing it was itself started by a message, which never wakes another chat, so two chats cannot wake each other forever. `NoticeNotes` hands waiting messages to the next prompt through `promptNotesFor`, and `unshownNotes` and `showNotices` show them to a person.
