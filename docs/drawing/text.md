# Text and reading order

A `text` and a `note` are both a `WrittenElement`: they carry `text`, a `size` and an optional `font` and `align`. Lines are `size * LINE_HEIGHT` apart, and `LINE_HEIGHT` is 1.25.

## Lines

`linesOf(element, measure)` returns the lines to draw:

| Element                | Lines                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `text` without `sized` | Its own line breaks only. The box follows the text, so the app grows it. |
| `text` with `sized`    | Wrapped to `w`.                                                          |
| `note`                 | Wrapped to the box minus `NOTE_PADDING` (16) on each side.               |

`writingFrameOf(element)` is where those lines start inside the element and how wide they may be. `textLines(text)` splits at line breaks; `wrapLines(text, maxWidth, measure)` also wraps at spaces, and breaks a word that does not fit on a line of its own between its characters. Wrapping only sets the width: a note with more text than room runs past the bottom of its sheet, and the app makes it taller.

`fontOf(font)` reads an absent font as `hand`. `DEFAULT_FONT_STACKS` names a stack per font for outside the app: Kalam for `hand`, the system font for `sans` and the system monospace for `mono`. The package ships no font files.

## Measuring

A `MeasureLine` takes a line and returns its width in world units. Without a font engine, `approximateMeasure(size, font)` counts characters: each is `0.6 * size` wide in `mono` and `0.55 * size` otherwise. That is close enough for a backend, but wraps differently from a browser. To match what a person sees, give `toSvg` a measure from a canvas, after the fonts loaded:

```ts
import { DEFAULT_FONT_STACKS, DEFAULT_PALETTE, fontOf, toSvg } from '@adecore/drawing';

await document.fonts.ready;
const context = document.createElement('canvas').getContext('2d')!;

const svg = toSvg(elements, {
    palette: DEFAULT_PALETTE,
    measure: (element) => (line) => {
        context.font = `${element.size}px ${DEFAULT_FONT_STACKS[fontOf(element.font)]}`;
        return context.measureText(line).width;
    }
});
```

If you pass `fonts`, measure with those stacks too.

## Reading order

`readingOrder(elements)` turns a drawing into lines of plain text, for an agent or for a text alternative next to the canvas. The [demo on the overview](/drawing/) prints them under the drawing:

First come the texts and notes that say something, top to bottom. Texts within 24 units of the top of a row count as that row and read left to right. Then every line with an arrow head becomes `from -> to`, read in the direction the head points. An end of an arrow takes the name of the nearest text, note or shape with a text inside that it lands on or whose center is within 48 units. An arrow with an end that names nothing, or with the same name at both ends, is left out.

It is a guess from positions, and it reads the unturned points of an arrow. When the connections matter, keep them as data: [`@adecore/diagram`](/diagram/) stores edges and reads them back exactly.
