# EmptyState

What a list, a canvas or a thread shows before it holds anything: one icon, one sentence, and at most one button.

```tsx
import { EmptyState } from '@basmilius/desktop-ui';
```

<Demo src="display/empty-state" />

The sentence says what is missing and what puts something there. A `title` above it is for a state that is an outcome, such as a search with no results, rather than a list with nothing in it yet. The icon is always 20 pixels. It can be a Lucide icon, or another mark that takes a `size`, such as a logo. While something loads, `busy` draws a [`Spinner`](/desktop-ui/display/spinner) in its place.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | | Required. One sentence. |
| `icon` | `LucideIcon \| ReactElement<{ size?: number }>` | | |
| `busy` | `boolean` | `false` | A `Spinner` in place of the icon, for a state that is still loading. |
| `spin` | `boolean` | `false` | Deprecated: turns a Lucide icon. Use `busy`. |
| `title` | `ReactNode` | | |
| `action` | `ReactNode` | | One button. |
| `className` | `string` | | |
| `ref` | `Ref<HTMLDivElement>` | | |

`EmptyStateProps` is an exported type.
