# Find and folding

## Find

The editor has the matcher of a find bar but not the bar: the app draws its own, or uses [`FindReplace`](/editor-react/find-replace).

<Demo src="editor/find" />

`find(query)` marks every match and moves to the first one from the caret; `null` removes the marks. An `EditorFindQuery` has `text`, `caseSensitive`, `wholeWord` and `regex`, and `inSelection: true` searches only what was selected when it turned on. `onFind(listener)` reports an `EditorFindState`: the `count`, the zero-based `current` match or `null`, and `noSelection` when a search in the selection has nothing selected. It reports again whenever an edit changes the count.

| Method                              | What it does                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `findStep(direction)`               | Moves to the next (`1`) or previous (`-1`) match                                   |
| `replace(replacement, options?)`    | Replaces the current match and moves on; `false` without a match or when read-only |
| `replaceAll(replacement, options?)` | Replaces every match in one undo step and returns how many                         |
| `setReplacePreview(replacement)`    | Draws what a regular expression writes for the current match; `null` removes it    |
| `selectFindMatches()`               | Ends the find with a caret on every match and returns how many                     |
| `endFind()`                         | Removes the marks and selects the current match                                    |
| `findFromCursor(query, direction)`  | Selects the next match from the caret without a find bar                           |

Matches never touch the selection until `endFind`. A regular expression expands `$1` and the like in the replacement, and `preserveCase: true` gives it the case of the text it replaces. An invalid regular expression finds nothing, and the editor marks at most 10,000 matches. A slow regular expression has no time limit.

## Folding

The editor reads the [folding ranges of the model](/editor-core/search-folding#folding-ranges) for its language, after a short pause once the text changes. Python and YAML also fold by indentation. A collapsed fold is one row for the line commands: delete, duplicate, comment, move and a copy without a selection take its hidden lines along.

`getFolds()` returns `EditorFolds`: the `collapsed` ranges and the `custom` ones made from a selection, as zero-based lines. Keep it with the scroll position and the caret, and pass it back as `folds` when the file opens again.

`foldDefaults` lists the [roles](/editor-core/search-folding#roles) that fold when a file opens without kept folds, such as `['imports', 'file-header']`. They fold once: never a range a person opened or closed, never one with the caret in it, and nothing after the first edit. As a language server names more ranges, through hints, those fold too.

`setFoldHints(hints)` hands over what a language server knows: `symbols` with their `range` and `body` kind, and `ranges` with their `kind`. They name the function, method and class bodies the text cannot tell apart. `null` forgets them.

The fold commands go through [`runCommand`](/editor/editing#commands).

## Blocks and sticky scroll

The editor reads the blocks of a document, the stretches with a header line such as a function, from brackets and indentation. Sticky scroll pins the headers of the blocks scrolled out of view, up to five lines and at most a quarter of the view. `onScope(listener)` reports the named blocks around the caret, outermost first, for a breadcrumb.

`setBlocks(blocks)` replaces those blocks with better ones, such as a language server's symbols: an `EditorBlock` has one-based `startLine` and `endLine`, and an optional `name` and `kind`. `null` goes back to the editor's own.

`setSelectionRanges(provider)` lets Extend Selection grow through a language server's ranges instead of the model's lexical ones; `null` goes back.
