# Theme and syntax

The page's theme colors the editor's chrome; the syntax theme colors the code. They are set apart: a page goes dark with `data-theme="dark"`, the code with `setTheme('github-dark')`. Change both together.

## CSS tokens

`editor.css` defines its tokens on `:root` and `[data-theme]`, on top of the tokens of the [`@adecore/ui` theme](/ui/guide/theme). Override any of them after the import.

| Token                                          | What it colors or sizes                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--code-font-size`, `--code-line-height`       | The code; `--text-code` and its line height by default                  |
| `--font-mono`                                  | The code face                                                           |
| `--editor-selection`, `--editor-occurrence`    | The selection and the marks of the other uses of the selected text      |
| `--editor-guide`, `--editor-guide-active`      | Indent guides, and the guide of the block around the caret              |
| `--editor-margin`, `--editor-whitespace`       | The right margin and the dots and arrows of whitespace                  |
| `--editor-added`, `--editor-modified`, `--editor-deleted` | Change marks                                                 |
| `--find-match`, `--find-current`, `--find-current-text` | Find matches                                                   |
| `--agent-1` to `--agent-6`, `--agent-ink`      | [Agent](/editor/agents) colors and the text on them                     |
| `--term-fg`                                    | The code's text color when set; `--text` otherwise                     |

Call `refreshFont()` after the font tokens change.

## Shiki

`shikiTokenizers` adapts a Shiki highlighter to the engine, and `shikiScopeColors` gives the engine a theme's colors by scope for [semantic tokens](#semantic-colors). Both take a function that returns the highlighter, so it loads only when an editor first needs it, and a code viewer elsewhere in the app can share it.

```ts
import { createHighlighter, type Highlighter } from 'shiki';
import { createSmartEditorEngine, shikiScopeColors, shikiTokenizers } from '@adecore/editor';

let highlighter: Promise<Highlighter> | undefined;
const getHighlighter = (): Promise<Highlighter> => (highlighter ??= createHighlighter({ themes: [], langs: [] }));

const engine = createSmartEditorEngine({
    tokenizer: shikiTokenizers(getHighlighter),
    scopeColors: shikiScopeColors(getHighlighter)
});
```

The adapter loads a language and a theme by their Shiki ids on first use. One Shiki does not know, or one that fails to load, is plain text. The languages a grammar embeds only on demand, such as `lang="scss"` in a Vue file or a fenced block in Markdown, load when the document names them when it opens; one added later is colored when the file opens again. For `php` the adapter colors the whole file as HTML with PHP between its tags. PHP inside an HTML attribute is not colored.

`loadGrammar(highlighter, grammar, text?)` and `documentLanguageOf(language)` from `@adecore/editor/shiki` are the steps the adapter takes, for a code viewer that colors the same way.

## A tokenizer of your own

A `TokenizerSource` is `(language, theme, text?) => Promise<LineTokenizer | null>`. A `LineTokenizer` colors one line at a time, from the state the line before it ended in:

- `tokenizeLine(text, state)` returns a `TokenizedLine`: `tokens`, whose `length`s add up to the line's length, and the `state` the next line starts from. The first line gets `null`. A `LineToken` has a CSS `color`, empty for the default, and a `fontStyle` of Shiki's flags: 1 italic, 2 bold, 4 underline, 8 strikethrough.
- `sameState(left, right)` tells the editor where coloring after an edit can stop. A wrong `true` leaves lines below the edit in stale colors.
- `stale?()` returns `true` once after the grammar was rebuilt, so the colors start over from the top.

The editor colors the lines on screen plus a margin, in slices, and recolors from the changed line down after an edit. The demos on this site use a tokenizer of about forty lines, in `docs/demos/shared/editor.ts`, that colors TypeScript keywords, strings, numbers and comments with theme tokens.

## Semantic colors

`setSemanticTokens` takes ranges with TextMate scopes, and `scopeColors(theme)` decides what the theme draws each scope stack in. A scope the theme says nothing about keeps the grammar's color. [`@adecore/editor-react`](/editor-react/hover#semantic-tokens-inlay-hints-and-folds) decodes a language server's semantic tokens into these.
