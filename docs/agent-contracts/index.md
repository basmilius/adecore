# @adecore/agent-contracts

The Zod schemas and TypeScript types that an agent chat host and its clients share: the frames on the wire, the requests and events, a chat and its items, providers and their models, accounts, tasks, worktrees and usage. The package opens no connection, starts no process and makes no permission decision. It runs in a browser, a preload and a Node or Bun backend alike.

```ts
import { AGENT_REQUEST_SCHEMAS, parseRequest } from '@adecore/agent-contracts';
```

[`@adecore/agents`](/agents/) is a host that answers these requests, and [`@adecore/agents-react`](/agents-react/) draws a chat from them. Either side can be your own: the schemas are the contract, not the implementations.

## Install

::: code-group

```sh [bun]
bun add @adecore/agent-contracts
```

```sh [npm]
npm install @adecore/agent-contracts
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add @adecore/agent-contracts
```

Zod 4 comes along as a dependency. There is no CSS and there are no words to load.

## A first check

A schema parses what crosses a boundary and throws on what does not fit. A type inferred from a schema describes the parsed output.

```ts
import { AGENT_REQUEST_SCHEMAS, ChatAttachmentUploadSchema } from '@adecore/agent-contracts';
import type { ChatSendPayload } from '@adecore/agent-contracts/chat';

const message: ChatSendPayload = {
    chatId: 'chat-1',
    text: 'Read the attached note.',
    attachments: [ChatAttachmentUploadSchema.parse({ name: 'note.txt', mime: 'text/plain', data: 'SGVsbG8=' })]
};

const payload = AGENT_REQUEST_SCHEMAS['chat.send'].payload.parse(message);
const result = AGENT_REQUEST_SCHEMAS['chat.send'].result.parse({ queued: false });
```

`.parse()` throws a `ZodError`; `.safeParse()` answers `{ success, data }` or `{ success, error }`. Object schemas are `z.object`, so a parse strips keys the schema does not know. Few fields have a default: an optional field that was left out stays absent, and the reader decides what absent means. The pages say it where that matters, such as an account without `enabled`, which is on.

## Entry points

The root exports everything below. Each group also has a subpath of its own, which a bundler can split on.
