The main process of an Electron app whose page draws its own interface. The page builds the application menu and shows where updating stands. The shell turns that menu into a native one and runs electron-updater. It also opens each window where it was left, puts the page's theme on the window and keeps the page's bridge in the app's own frame.

**[Documentation](https://adecore.dev/shell/)**

## Install

```sh
bun add @adecore/shell
```

Electron 44 or later and electron-updater are optional peer dependencies; the app brings its own. The package imports only their types, so a test runs in Bun without Electron.

## Nothing listens on its own

The package registers no IPC handler and listens to no app-wide Electron event. Every IPC message from the page crosses a security boundary, so the app wires each channel itself, behind its own check of the sender (`isAppSender`), and calls into the package from there.

## Entry points

| Import | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `@adecore/shell` | For the main process: `createWindows`, `createWindowState`, `createUpdater`, `createTheme`, `menuTemplateOf`, `staticMenuTemplate`, `createMenuCommands`, `createPageKeys` and the web guards |
| `@adecore/shell/bridge` | The shapes that cross IPC: `MenuSpec`, `MenuNode`, `MENU_ROLES`, `UpdateState`, `ThemeState` and `compareVersions`. It imports nothing from Electron, so a preload and the page read it too. |
